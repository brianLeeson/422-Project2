This project is made to be extended and built upon. This is a list of potential areas that we could improve this project.
It is not a todo list, but a list of ideas that could be implemented if possible and useful. This is a more detailed list
than the "Ideas for Project Improvement" section of the README.md

Send appointment reminder emails.

Run the flask server on a hosting service like Heroku to provide security and stability.

Once email reminders have been sent for the day, prevent a second round of emails.

We would like to send a professionally formatted email, potentially with embedded HTML.

Make event description parsing more robust.

Make a more general format that could be applied for more cases, potentially for other department

Database backend and web front end. Make it so that users don't have to click everyday. his would require a complete
over-hall of the project.
