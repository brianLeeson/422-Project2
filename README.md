### Description:
This is a project for GreenHill humane society foster program to assist with daily medication reminders.
The reminder events are stored in google calendar. When using our website the user will give permission
to access their calendar. Our flask server will then parse the relevant medication data from the reminder
calendar and send emails to the appropriate foster families.

### Dependencies:
This project has been set up to run in a virtual environment in order to support installations on
platforms where the user may not have root permissions and to better insulate this project from the
host machine. All current dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. If the project were to be extended,
further instructions have been left in the Makefile on how to add dependencies in the virtual environment.
The critical dependencies that must already exist or be installed with root access are:
git  
python 3.*  
bash shell  

### Instructions:  
Setup:
 * Make sure all critical dependencies are installed.
 * "git clone https://github.com/brianLeeson/422-Project2".
 * Configure and run the project with "make run".
 * Connect to the server locally with or externally
 * Authenticate by clicking "TODO THING NAME"
 * Select which reminders you would like to have sent.
